# ACF Flexible Visibility
Contributors: devgeniem, Nomafin
Tags: acf, wordpress
Requires at least: 5.0.0.0

## Description

This plugin adds an option to ignore certain page templates when declaring ACF Flexible Content layouts so that these ignored templates won't be available on pages that use selected templates.

This is handy when using our [Reusable Field Group](https://github.com/devgeniem/acf-reusable-field-group) plugin where you can include field groups to another.

### In the future

So far this plugin only supports pages and matching with the page templates, but maybe in the future it will have another options too, like declaring visibility by user role etc.

## Install

Recommended installation to a WordPress project is through composer:
```
$ composer require devgeniem/acf-flexible-visibility
```
